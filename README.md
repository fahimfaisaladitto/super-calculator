# Project Structure
<h4 align="left">The project is organized into three separate files for better maintainability. </h4>

• index.html: This file contains the core structure and content of the web application. It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

• style.css: This file holds all the custom CSS, including theme variables for light/dark modes, animations, and specific component styles.

• script.js: This file contains all the JavaScript code that powers the application's functionality, from handling inputs to managing the UI.

# Setup and Installation
<h4 align="left">Since this project uses basic web technologies with no external dependencies (other than CDN links), the setup is straightforward. </h4>

• Clone or Download: Get a copy of all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js).

• Keep Files Together: Ensure that all three files are located in the same folder or directory.

• Open in Browser: Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
